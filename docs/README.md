## Continuous integration

Every configured pull request runs practical smoke coverage and a dedicated PHPCS/PHPStan job. Pull requests targeting `main` or `release-2.x` additionally run the required MySQL/WP-CLI WordPress rendering fixture and a CI-seeded Whisk Storybook accessibility audit. Weekly scheduled runs repeat both extended fixtures. Manual readiness runs use the `wordpress_fixture` and `extended_checks` inputs to select those extended jobs. The release process documents commands, route coverage, and merge-gate details.
