# Parent and child theme architecture

Emulsify WordPress is split into a reusable parent theme and generated project child themes. The goal is to keep parent runtime behavior stable while allowing each project to own its implementation details.

## Parent theme responsibilities

The parent theme owns reusable runtime behavior:

- WordPress bootstrap code.
- Theme setup, menus, editor support, and image sizes.
- Timber integration and global context.
- Twig namespace registration and helper functions.
- Asset loading for built child and parent files.
- Optional ACF Local JSON save/load path support.
- Optional ACF/Twig block registration.
- Optional native Gutenberg block registration.
- Optional JSON block pattern registration.
- Optional block editor governance when configured by a child theme.
- Minimal Timber fallback templates.

Most parent runtime code lives in `includes/`. The root `functions.php` should stay thin.

Runtime classes are grouped by domain: `Runtime`, `Blocks`, `Editor`, `Acf`, `Cli`, `Support`, and `Twig`. Composer PSR-4 autoloading loads these classes when Composer is available, and Bootstrap keeps a small fallback loader for manual theme installs without Composer.

## Child theme responsibilities

Generated child themes own:

- Project components in the structure supplied by the selected Emulsify component system.
- Project Sass and JavaScript defined by that component system or by the project.
- Storybook stories and data fixtures.
- Built Vite output under `dist/`.
- Intentional template overrides.
- Project-specific filters or hooks.

The bundled Whisk starter is an example child theme. Real projects can generate a renamed child theme with WP-CLI.

## Template fallback model

The parent `templates/` directory contains complete minimal fallbacks. The generated child theme only ships a small example override at `whisk/templates/page.twig`.

Timber resolves the `@templates` namespace child-first:

1. Child theme `templates`.
2. Parent theme `templates`.

The parent-only `@emulsify-tpl` namespace points at parent templates. Use it when a child override needs to extend the parent fallback it is replacing.

## Component discovery priority

Built child theme components are discovered before built parent theme components. When a child and parent component use the same relative path under `dist/components`, the child component wins for both ACF/Twig `*.component.json` metadata and native `block.json` metadata.

Discovery is memoized for the current PHP request. ACF/Twig and native block registration share one filesystem scan by default.

## Asset resolution priority

Built assets are resolved child-first. When `dist/emulsify-assets.json` exists and is valid, the manifest is used before recursive scanner fallback for each asset scope. If a child manifest is valid, it takes priority over the parent manifest; if a scope is missing or invalid, that scope falls back to scanning built child and parent directories.

Manifest reads are memoized per `AssetManifest` instance during a request. Scanner fallback also memoizes raw file records per theme-relative directory, then filters CSS and JavaScript in memory for each enqueue pass while preserving the existing asset filters.

## Optional persistent discovery cache

Persistent component discovery caching is enabled by default in production and staging environments, and disabled by default in local, development, or `WP_DEBUG` environments. Projects can still opt out or force it on with:

```php
add_filter( 'emulsify_theme_component_discovery_cache_enabled', '__return_false' );
```

The transient cache key includes the active stylesheet, parent template, child theme version, parent theme version, WordPress environment type, and `dist/emulsify-assets.json` filemtime when that manifest exists. The runtime also calls `clear_discovery_cache` on WordPress' `switch_theme` hook so changing themes invalidates the active cache key.

Projects that customize component roots dynamically can add their own invalidation token with `emulsify_theme_component_discovery_cache_key_parts`. The default cache lifetime can be adjusted with `emulsify_theme_component_discovery_cache_ttl`.

To clear the current cache key from project code, a maintenance command, or custom deployment logic, call:

```php
\Emulsify\Theme\Blocks\ComponentLocator::clear_discovery_cache();
```

For new project component includes, prefer the generated child theme machine name from `project.emulsify.json`, using the general form `{% include "project_machine_name:component_name" %}`. The legacy `@components/component-name/component-name.twig` namespace remains supported for compatible component libraries, existing projects, shared templates, and migration work.

When a selected component system needs custom legacy namespaces, define them once in `project.emulsify.json` with Emulsify Core's `variant.structureImplementations` array. The WordPress runtime reads that same shape for Timber, keeping Storybook/Core and PHP-rendered templates aligned without adding Drupal-style `.info.yml` metadata.

## Runtime filters

Child themes and project plugins can extend parent behavior with focused WordPress filters:

- `emulsify_theme_asset_directories`
- `emulsify_theme_asset_files`
- `emulsify_theme_twig_namespaces`
- `emulsify_theme_project_component_roots`
- `emulsify_theme_context`
- `emulsify_theme_acf_json_enabled`
- `emulsify_theme_acf_json_save_path`
- `emulsify_theme_acf_json_load_paths`
- `emulsify_theme_acf_json_remove_default_load_path`
- `emulsify_theme_component_roots`
- `emulsify_theme_component_discovery_cache_enabled`
- `emulsify_theme_component_discovery_cache_key_parts`
- `emulsify_theme_component_discovery_cache_ttl`
- `emulsify_theme_acf_block_metadata`
- `emulsify_theme_acf_block_args`
- `emulsify_theme_native_block_directories`
- `emulsify_theme_pattern_directories`
- `emulsify_theme_pattern_data`
- `emulsify_theme_pattern_categories`
- `emulsify_theme_pattern_args`
- `emulsify_theme_setup_options`
- `emulsify_theme_editor_policy_options`
- `emulsify_theme_allowed_block_types`
- `emulsify_theme_pattern_namespaces`
- `emulsify_theme_block_support_overrides`

Use these filters for project-specific behavior before editing a parent class. Keep broad application logic in a project plugin when it is not theme-specific.

## Emulsify project metadata

The generated child theme includes `project.emulsify.json` with `"platform": "wordpress"`. Emulsify Core and Emulsify CLI tooling use that adapter value for WordPress-aware project behavior, while reusable WordPress runtime support remains in this parent theme.

Generated child themes also record `generatedFrom: "emulsify-wordpress"` and `generatedFromVersion`. These fields identify the starter lineage for future upgrades, support diagnostics, and safer replacement checks.

Use WordPress-native files for WordPress concerns: `style.css` headers for theme identity and `theme.json` for editor/global style settings. Use `project.emulsify.json` for Emulsify project metadata that Core and project tooling need to share.
