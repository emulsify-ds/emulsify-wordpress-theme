# Emulsify WordPress

Emulsify WordPress 2.0.0 is a Timber-first WordPress parent theme for teams building component-driven sites with Emulsify Core 4, Vite, Storybook, and Twig.

The parent theme provides the WordPress runtime: theme setup, Timber bootstrapping, Twig namespaces and helpers, template fallbacks, asset loading, and optional block registration. Generated child themes provide the project layer: components, templates, source Sass and JavaScript, compiled assets, and site-specific overrides.

## Installation

### Composer (primary)

Track the parent theme through the site project's Composer configuration and install it as `emulsify`:

```sh
composer require emulsify-ds/emulsify-wordpress
```

Composer-based applications should also require `timber/timber` from the application-level Composer project so Timber loads before WordPress activates the theme. If the parent theme owns its dependencies instead, run `composer install` inside the installed `emulsify` directory.

### Manual release ZIP

Download `emulsify.zip` from the matching [GitHub release](https://github.com/emulsify-ds/emulsify-wordpress/releases), then upload it through Appearance > Themes > Add New > Upload Theme. The release ZIP already includes production Composer dependencies under `vendor/`, so a manual installation does not need to run Composer.

The archive installs into the required `emulsify/` directory. A WordPress.org listing and SVN deployment are planned as a future release step; they are not part of the current release workflow.

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.7 or newer.
- PHP 8.3 or newer.
- Composer 2 for Composer-based installation and parent-theme maintenance.
- Node.js 24. Root release tooling expects `>=24.10`; generated child themes expect `>=24`.
- Timber 2, installed by the site project or bundled in the manual release ZIP.
- WP-CLI when generating child themes or running the full WordPress fixture smoke test.

## Using Emulsify WordPress in a site project

Install the parent theme as `emulsify` and pair it with a child theme for project work. In Bedrock, that usually means:

```sh
web/app/themes/emulsify
web/app/themes/whisk
```

In a standard WordPress install, use:

```sh
wp-content/themes/emulsify
wp-content/themes/whisk
```

Timber 2 must be loaded before the theme renders. Composer-based site projects can satisfy that requirement in either place:

- Require `timber/timber` from the application-level Composer project.
- Run Composer inside the parent theme when the parent theme owns its PHP dependencies:

```sh
cd web/app/themes/emulsify
composer install
```

Activate the child theme, not the parent theme. The child theme header includes `Template: emulsify`, which tells WordPress to use Emulsify as the parent runtime.

Do not run root npm commands in the parent theme for normal site implementation. Project frontend work happens in the generated child theme.

## Working inside a generated child theme

Run component, Vite, Storybook, and project lint commands from the generated child theme:

```sh
cd web/app/themes/whisk
npm install
```

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run build` | Build Core 4 assets with Vite. |
| `npm run vite` | Watch and rebuild Vite assets. |
| `npm run storybook` | Start Storybook on port 6006. |
| `npm run develop` | Run the Vite watcher and Storybook together. |
| `npm run storybook-build` | Build assets and export a static Storybook. |
| `npm run lint` | Run JavaScript and Sass linting with the Core 4 config. |
| `npm run audit` | Run the Core migration/static audit. |
| `npm run audit:twig-stories` | Check Twig story compatibility. |
| `npm run a11y` | Build Storybook and run the Core accessibility check. |
| `npm run test` | Run Jest with `--passWithNoTests` for starter projects. |

## Parent and child themes

The `emulsify` parent theme owns reusable runtime behavior:

- `includes/` contains the namespaced runtime classes.
- `templates/` provides minimal Timber fallback templates.
- `theme.json` provides editor settings and presets.
- `whisk/` is the generated starter child theme source.

The generated `whisk` child theme owns project implementation:

- `whisk/src/components` is an empty placeholder until a project installs the component system it wants to use.
- Source Sass, JavaScript, stories, data fixtures, and component metadata are defined by the selected Emulsify component system, not by this parent theme starter.
- `whisk/assets/images` and `whisk/assets/icons` are empty placeholders for project-owned theme media and icon files.
- `whisk/templates/page.twig` is a small example override.
- `whisk/dist/global` and `whisk/dist/components` are runtime build output conventions when a component system emits them.
- `whisk/project.emulsify.json` uses `"platform": "wordpress"` so Core and CLI tooling can load the WordPress platform adapter. It also records `generatedFrom` and `generatedFromVersion` so future upgrades and support diagnostics can identify Emulsify-generated WordPress child themes. Projects can also use Core-supported metadata such as `variant.structureImplementations` there when a selected component system needs legacy Twig namespaces.

## Bedrock and Timber

Timber is required for frontend template rendering. This repository declares `timber/timber` in the parent theme `composer.json`, so a standalone theme install can run Composer inside the parent theme.

For Bedrock applications, it is also valid to require Timber from the application-level Composer project as long as WordPress loads that Composer autoloader before the theme renders. If Timber is missing, the parent theme shows an actionable admin notice and stops frontend rendering with a clear runtime error.

## Developing or releasing the parent theme

Parent-theme root commands are for maintainers and release checks, not normal project frontend development. Run them from the parent theme repository root:

```sh
composer install
npm ci --ignore-scripts
```

Composer install creates the runtime autoloader. After adding or renaming parent runtime classes, run `composer dump-autoload` so Composer's optimized classmap sees the current files. The supported manual release ZIP ships that autoloader and its production dependencies; a source checkout without `vendor/` still uses the Bootstrap fallback loader.

### Linting and static analysis

Install the PHP development dependencies, then run the combined coding-standards and static-analysis command:

```sh
composer install
npm run lint:php
```

`lint:php` runs PHPCS with `phpcs.xml.dist`, followed by PHPStan with `phpstan.neon.dist`. Both configurations cover `includes/` and the parent theme's root PHP entry points, including `functions.php`. Use `npm run lint:php:fix` to apply safe PHPCBF coding-standard fixes, then rerun `npm run lint:php` to confirm PHPStan and the remaining PHPCS checks.

The `.husky/pre-commit` hook already runs `npm run lint`, which delegates to this PHP check.

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run lint:php` | Run PHPCS and PHPStan across the parent runtime. |
| `npm run pr:check` | Run the practical, stubbed pull request validation suite. |
| `npm run release:check` | Run release-readiness checks. |
| `npm run build:dist` | Build the installable `dist-artifact/emulsify.zip` release archive. |
| `npm run publish-test -- --no-ci` | Run a local semantic-release dry run. |

Pull requests to the configured release branches run four visible readiness jobs: practical smoke checks, dedicated PHPCS/PHPStan analysis, the MySQL-backed WordPress fixture, and a Whisk Storybook accessibility audit. The WordPress job sets `WP_SMOKE_REQUIRED=1`, so missing WP-CLI/MySQL prerequisites or route render failures fail the job instead of producing a skip. The Whisk job copies an accessible CI-only story and Vite entry into the otherwise component-agnostic starter before building and running axe.

Nightly scheduled runs repeat the WordPress fixture and Whisk accessibility audit. Manual GitHub Actions > `WordPress Theme Readiness` runs can select either extended fixture with the `wordpress_fixture` and `extended_checks` inputs. Local `release:check` still skips the database fixture when prerequisites are unavailable unless `WP_SMOKE_REQUIRED=1` is set. Release publishing also requires the full WordPress fixture path before semantic-release can publish.

## Generate a child theme

Generate a project child theme from the bundled Whisk starter with WP-CLI:

```sh
wp emulsify "Acme Site" --dry-run
wp emulsify "Acme Site" --machine-name=acme-site
wp emulsify "Acme Site" --machine-name=acme-site --parent=emulsify
wp emulsify "Acme Site" --machine-name=acme-site --force
wp emulsify "Acme Site" --machine-name=acme-site --activate
```

The generator copies `<parent>/whisk` to a sibling child theme directory, updates WordPress theme headers, package metadata, Emulsify project metadata, and visible starter labels, then optionally activates the generated child theme. `--parent=<slug>` selects a different installed parent theme directory; it defaults to `emulsify`.

`--force` only replaces an existing destination when its WordPress platform, `generatedFrom: "emulsify-wordpress"` lineage, generated version, parent template, and machine name all match the requested generated child theme. The replacement is staged atomically so a copy failure leaves the existing theme intact; use `--dry-run --force` to inspect replacement intent without deleting files.

For Emulsify CLI integration, the standalone starter repository is `https://github.com/emulsify-ds/emulsify-wordpress-starter`. It represents the generated child theme layer from `whisk/`, not the parent runtime theme root, and generated projects still declare `Template: emulsify` so WordPress loads the installed parent theme.
